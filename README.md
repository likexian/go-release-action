# Go Release Action

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Automate publishing Go build binary artifacts to GitHub releases through GitHub Actions.

## Usage

### Basic Example

Release single artifact for linux amd64 with default option when tag push.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yaml
# Maintainer: https://www.likexian.com
# Licensed under the Apache License 2.0

name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Release code
        uses: likexian/go-release-action@v0.3.0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          GOOS: linux
          GOARCH: amd64
```
